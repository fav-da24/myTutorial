1. Global Scope:
    Global scope is like a big box that you can access from anywhere in your program.

    When a variable is defined in the global scope, it means that it can be used in any part of your code, no matter where it is.

    For example:

    ```x = 10  # Global variable

    def my_function():
        print(x)  # You can access 'x' here because it's in the global scope

    my_function()  # This will print 10```

    In this example, x is a global variable, so the function my_function() can use it.

2. Local Scope:
    Local scope is like a smaller box that only exists inside certain parts of your program, like inside a function.

    Variables defined inside a local scope can only be used within that specific area, usually inside a function or a block of code.

    For example:

    ```def my_function():
        y = 5  # Local variable
        print(y)  # You can use 'y' inside the function

    my_function()  # This will print 5
    print(y)  # This will give an error, because 'y' is not available outside the function```

    Here, y is a local variable inside my_function(). You can use it inside the function, but if you try to access it outside, it doesn't exist anymore.

Quick Summary:
Global scope: Available everywhere.
Local scope: Available only within a specific function or block of code.
This helps keep your variables organized and prevents confusion!
