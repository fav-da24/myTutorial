web forum to ask people:
1. Stack Overflow - https://stackoverflow.com/
2. "learn programming" subreddit - https://reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/

be sure to read the FAQ sections about the proper way to post questions

When asking programming questions, remember to do the following:
1. Explain what you are trying to do, not just what you did. This lets your helper know if you are on the wrong track.
2. Specify the point at which the error happens. Does it occur at the very start of the program or only after you do a certain action?
3. Copy and paste the entire error message and your code to https://pastebin.com/ or https://gist.github.com/.
These websites make it easy to share large amounts of code with people online, without losing any text formatting. You can then put the URL of the posted code in your email or forum post. For example, here some pieces of code I’ve posted: https://pastebin.com/SzP2DbFx/ and https://gist.github.com/asweigart/6912168/.
4. Explain what you’ve already tried to do to solve your problem. This tells people you’ve already put in some work to figure things out on your own.
5. List the version of Python you’re using. (There are some key differences between version 2 Python interpreters and version 3 Python interpreters.) Also, say which operating system and version you’re running.
6. If the error came up after you made a change to your code, explain exactly what you changed.
7. Say whether you’re able to reproduce the error every time you run the program or whether it happens only after you perform certain actions. If the latter, then explain what those actions are.
