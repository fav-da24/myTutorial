To use pandas, you'll typically start with the following line of code.
  ``import pandas as pd``

Creating Data (two core object in Pandas: DataFRame and Series)
1.  DataFrame - is a table
    Simple DataFrame
    1. ``pd.DataFrame({'Yes': [50, 21], 'No': [131, 2]})``
    2. ``pd.DataFrame({'Bob': ['I liked it.', 'It was awful.'], 'Sue': ['Pretty good.', 'Bland.']})``

    - The list of row labels used in a DataFrame is known as an Index. 
    - We can assign values to it by using an index parameter in our constructor:
    ``pd.DataFrame({'Bob': ['I liked it.', 'It was awful.'], 
              'Sue': ['Pretty good.', 'Bland.']},
             index=['Product A', 'Product B'])``

2.  Series - is a sequence of data
    1. ``pd.Series([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])``
    2. ``pd.Series([30, 35, 40], index=['2015 Sales', '2016 Sales', '2017 Sales'], name='Product A')``
    3. `` quantities = ['4 cups', '1 cup', '2 large', '1 can']
          items = ['Flour', 'Milk', 'Eggs', 'Spam']
          recipe = pd.Series(quantities, index=items, name='Dinner')```

Reading Data Files
  ``wine_reviews = pd.read_csv("../input/wine-reviews/winemag-data-130k-v2.csv")``

- We can use the shape attribute to check how large the resulting DataFrame is:
  ``wine_reviews.shape``

- We can examine the contents of the resultant DataFrame using the head() command, which grabs the first five rows:
  ``wine_reviews.head()``

- To make pandas use CSV built in index column for the index (instead of creating a new one from scratch), we can specify an index_col.
  ``wine_reviews = pd.read_csv("../input/wine-reviews/winemag-data-130k-v2.csv", index_col=0)``
  ``wine_reviews.head()``

- Code to save DataFrame to disk as a csv file with the name cows_and_goats.csv
  ``animals.to_csv("cows_and_goats.csv")``
